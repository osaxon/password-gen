# Password Generator

## About

A simple application which generates a password of a user specified length. The look and feel of the page has been built with HTML and CSS, whilst the logic which generates the password is done using JavaScript functions.

The application takes user input to determine the length of the generated password, and also allows the person using the app to include or exclude different character types.

The script in the background generates a random array based on the criteria given and then generates a password. I've included a check at the final stage of the script to ensure the generated password meets all the criteria; should one of the tests fail, a new password will be generated.
